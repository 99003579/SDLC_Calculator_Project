Accelerated Aging Time (AAT)

Accelerated Aging – oftentimes referred to as Accelerated Shelf-Life Testing – is commonly used in the medical device industry to accelerate the effects of time on a Sterile Barrier System to establish Shelf Life parameters. The Accelerated Aging process is based on the relationship of temperature and reaction rate where an increase in temperature increases the reaction rate.
